              What’s the single most consequential thing that has affected our time in school? It’s the pandemic. During that time, my peers were among the most confused by the overwhelming public health messages, mixed with chaos and misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              One weekend after the lockdown was lifted, we drove to Walden Pond, the birthplace of Thoreau’s transcendentalism. Carefully keeping distant from others, I posed my puzzle to Dad: “Why don’t people believe the public health messaging?”
            </p>
            <p>
              He took some time to contemplate. After giving way to two passersby, he replied, “Perhaps it suggests that we, as a society, haven’t reached a strong consensus on the ultimate value of science.”
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the gentlemen who just passed by suddenly stopped and turned around. In a genuinely weighted voice, mixed with surprise and relief, he joined, “That’s exactly what I was telling my son last night!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Caught in this unexpected turn, I stood there watching. He and Dad began shaking hands! I couldn’t tell which shocked me more, either that they clearly shared a mind before this moment, or that they violated social distancing. They chatted awhile, then parted ways. “Do we know him?” I asked Dad. “No,” he replied. “And we don’t need to.”
            </p>
            <p>
              According to an Associated Press report, math and reading scores of American K-12 students slipped to the lowest level in a decade last year. This compels a response: how to improve academic education and promote the value of science? Nobody knows when the next pandemic will hit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before this encounter, friends and I had initiated Zoom sessions to prepare for our Science Bowl competition. I now saw the platform as a chance to do more. We started an online camp for enthusiastic young learners, helped them understand how nature works and instilled the knowledge and desire to find answers. We incorporated demonstrations and lectures about biological processes, computer science, and even the technologies behind mRNA vaccines. To our great surprise, 70 students showed up on the first day. We also ran a donation campaign, raising over $600 for COVID relief fund.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 5 years and hundreds of enrollments, we became an incubator of successful academic teams of local schools, and have expanded to a year-round community science education program. Another achievement is our tightly-knit team stays strong with over 20 instructors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, we can now see there was a bigger Walden Pond moment converging in a bigger community. Educational resources have exploded since the pandemic. People joined forces and worked for this purpose. Not only could I take many extracurricular courses, I also met Joe Hanson, the famous YouTuber whose science channel Be Smart is my favorite. As the host of WGBH's High School Quiz Show, Joe presented me with the championship trophy this spring.
            </p>
            <p>
              I often think of that gentleman at Walden. In a time of dark desperation and social separation, we offered each other confidence that shared common values, wills, and endeavors always exist: keeping everyone safe, kids educated, and the community united. Humanity’s defense against this new contagion was hardly a success. However, we know where we fell short and how to fix it. Maybe one day, more will turn around and join the conversation, comforted and strengthened by knowing that we still wish to live deliberately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The section below is what I would offer to this conversation and my efforts to share the full sublimity of that moment at Walden Pond.
