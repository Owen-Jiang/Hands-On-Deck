              <p>While the battery has not been bought yet, I do need to start thinking about how it would be possible to remove the original battery out of the car, when the ground clearance is only 6 inches and the entire battery is at least a foot tall. I could lift the entire car like in those typically car mechanic shops, but I don't want to do that. Jacks on the ground also can only lift the car by so much. Either way, this cheap liftable table would work fine, except that it doesn't have any wheels to pull the battery out once I've removed it.</p>

              <p>The next step in the process is to replace the battery of the 2012 Nissan LEAF. Unfortunately, several problems are still unresolved at the moment.</p>
              <p>The goal of replacing the battery is not just to make the car itself run longer—it's to make a point about reusability. If all humans on Earth magically switched to their favorite electric vehicle and we all stopped polluting <code>CO₂</code> into the atmosphere, there is still the question of waste. It's clear that we shouldn't have to just dump the battery simply because it doesn't work for a car—it could very much work for us in other ways. A stationary power source conserves many more resources and is better in the long run than just returning it to the factory or buying another car.</p>
              <p>Now, how do we give this <code>24 kWh</code> battery a second life? We first have to get the new battery here. This has been quite the hurdle so far.</p>
              <p>Here's a brief table explaining the different battery capacities that the Nissan LEAF has had over the years. Hover on anything underlined to learn more. (Note that S, SV, and SL stand for <strong>S</strong>eries, <strong>S</strong>eries <strong>V</strong>alue, and <strong>S</strong>eries <strong>L</strong>uxury, supposedly.)</p>

              <p>The best car batteries out in the market so far have only been around since 2019, and very few of them would likely need to be replaced at this moment. To check, I called 6 junkyards all around my region, but not one of them had a single Nissan LEAF that was even wrecked, much less one that had a spare <code>62 kWh</code> traction battery lying around. After I looked on Reddit to see if others have walked down my path in the past before, it made more sense—there were cross-country deals going on, simply because there was so little supply.</p>
              <p>At this point, I must thank Jack, who worked at one of the junkyards nearby and directed me to <a href="https://nationwideautorecycling.com/">Nationwide Auto Recycling</a> and recommended that I check on auto parts online (something that I had never really known was a thing). Checking every so often led me to a $7000 battery, still intact from a totalled 2019 model. Since the ones on <a href="https://qccharge.com/products/battery-high-voltage-traction-new-for-nissan-leaf?variant=44417197015199">QCCharge</a> asked for $500 more, this seemed like a great deal. I was about to make the call when I checked the VIN number and realized it was not a Plus model. Defeated again.</p>
              <p>Even despite numerous attempts to find other parts online, there didn't seem to be anything coming in. And so I thought for a few days about how I would proceed.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>While scrolling through YouTube Shorts a few days later, I found a few videos from a few companies specializing in lithium-ion battery manufacture, all based around Shenzhen, with corresponding WhatsApp numbers. These companies would prepare separate units and then combine them into packages so that the total output would reach 63 kWh, and the entire box could be shipped anywhere worldwide. As of right now, I'm currently analyzing prices and seeing whether or not I can get something out of this. We'll have to see how this turns out. But in either case, if you happen to find a <code>62 kWh</code> Nissan LEAF battery lying around, I could use it.</p>

              <p class="blog-post-meta">March 30, 2024</p>
              <p>For the past few months, a persistent squealing and screeching sound growling louder and longer whenever the Sienna starts. (You can hear it <a href="../images/PXL_20240327_211819972.TS.264.mp4">here</a> when I'm trying to see if the battery will start.) My mom complained that it was getting very annoying, so it was up to me to see what could be done. Like many problems, it was initially difficult to pinpoint where the squealing noise exactly came from, but as a rule of thumb, always start with the easiest thing to check and fix.</a>
              <p>That would be the serpentine belts, probably either the one connecting the alternator/generator, the A/C compressor, and the crankshaft pulley, or the one connected the crankshaft pulley and the power steering. These belts can loosen and potentially create the noise heard. Among the two belts, no doubt the first choice would be to start from the higher belt (the one connecting the alternator and A/C), since it would be much easier to reach and deal with in the event that it was in fact responsible. Two theories were plausible explanations for creating noise:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The ridges on the inside of the belt were worn out and had breakages in between</li>
                <li>There was not as much tension on the belt after so many years of use and it would slip on the pulley during a cold start</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="row mt-5 mb-5 justify-content-between align-items-center">
                <div class="col-lg-8">
                  <p>Upon examination, the belt was having trouble turning the crankshaft pulley, only making it turn and having the sound die down. The sound could last as long as two to three minutes after ignition and could get even worse when the temperature was low or when the fan was on. Rubbing the back of the belt didn't seem to indicate that the ridges had broken.</p>
                  <p>A simple trick to check the tension of these belts in general is to see whether or not the belt can be twisted 90° at the middle section of its longest span. When I tried this, I was able to turn the belt almost 180° and noted the ridges seemed to be pretty okay as well, with not too much wear. It seemed we were dealing with something near the domain of theory 2.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <p>Screws A (<code>14 mm</code>) and B (<code>12 mm</code>) would have to be loosened and only then could screw C (also <code>12 mm</code>) be used to adjust the tension.</p>
                  <p>When I put my wrench to the screws, the 17 years of the car made it very clear that they really did not want to be loosened. An application of WD-40 did not change this fact at all, so I made my way to my torque wrench, which gave me a longer arm as a breaker bar.</p>
                  <p>However, the head of the torque wrench was too big to fit into the car's space. Because both sides of the torque wrench had a size of <code>1/2"</code>, a <code>1/2"</code> to <code>3/8"</code> chrome vanadium adapter was needed to get my <code>14 mm</code> or <code>12 mm</code> socket in place, adding to the size when I only had <code>6 cm</code> of clearance. After a long time struggling, it seemed the only solution was to use a joint socket with a head short enough to fit in that space.</p>

                  <p>One trip to AutoZone store, $2.99, and 24 hours later, I had my <code>3/8"</code>-sized joint socket in hand.</p>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>The biggest problem with this job was that because of the sheer number of wires and pipes in the way, I had to wrangle the torque wrench in and out the space at every given turn—I only had about 60° of rotational space to work with. What's more, due to the design of the joint socket (in that it finds the easiest way for it to rotate), some arrangements of the entire wrench mechanism were unable to effectively attach to screw A or B and then turn it. Thus, I had to take the joint socket off, rotate it 90°, and see if I could now the wrench could fit and create the torque I needed. This took a lot of time and effort to visualize. (Also interesting to note, and important if you do this in the future—using a joint socket prevents you from taking a torque reading if you use a wrench like that one I did—it simply becomes a bar that you can push and rotate in the plane perpendicular to the bar of metal with all the number readings. A click type is better.)</p>

              </div>
              <p>Eventually, I got both screws A and B loosened (with more WD-40 encouragement and using the smaller <code>1/4"</code> wrench once the screw started to turn). I started to loosen screw C just to make sure it was working. Sure enough, the belt was getting looser. Good. I then retightened screw C and rotated it about 20 times (also with only about 60° of rotational space, so roughly 3.3 full rotations), checking every so often how much I could rotate the belt. Finally, it was sufficiently tight (90° turn) and I tried my best to retighten screws A and B, even though I had to estimate the amount of torque and try to make it match manual specifications.</p>

              <p>Overall, the entire process of loosening and tightening three screws cost about 5 hours spread over 2 days, oil-greased hands, and one small scratch on my right pinky. But I'm happy it's not something worse, and that it was addressed before it got worse.</p>
              <p>It seems that new models with an automatic tensioner are less likely to have this problem, but at the same time, when the tensioners do break, they would be harder to service. Fortunately, Toyota is well-known for quality control and friendly servicing.</p>

              <p class="blog-post-meta">February 1, 2024</p>
              <p>My family has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf_(first_generation)">2013 Nissan LEAF</a>, a blue one that has been with us for some time as well. It also has some problems: the on-board charger, effectively a rectifier (AC to DC) that allows the battery pack to charge, has some problems, and the central screen of the car has malfunctioned (the flippling mechanism), causing a parasite current when the car is parked.</p>
              <p>I have the same screen issue as <a href="https://mynissanleaf.com/threads/touch-screen-opens-and-closes-by-itself.9620/">this</a> and similar OBC problems as <a href="https://mynissanleaf.com/threads/can-trickle-charger-break-obc.25134/">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/srbZWoMiJ1U">here</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ofhfCVIo5eM">here</a>, but I will have to dig deeper.</p>

              <p>This vehicle was part of the first generation of mass-produced electric cars, years before the Tesla Model X first hit the streets—this car in particular was one of the earliest in my town, back when I was 6 years old.</p>
              <p>A bit of a personal touch—my dad told me that he wished that I would learn to drive using this car, and I finally got a go with it on my 16th birthday in an empty parking lot.</p>
              <p>Since there are some problems with it now, my parents promised me that if I could get the car fixed, it would be mine. As such, I am endeavoring to fix it, upgrade it, and recycle the old battery for use as our home's backup battery supply.</p>

              <p class="blog-post-meta">January 25, 2024</p>
              <p>One day, the car that my mom drove refused to start. Since it was an old car, I guessed that the battery voltage was likely too low.</p>
              <hr>
              <ol>
                <li>I lifted the hood and pulled the lead-acid battery out and took it into the garage to charge overnight. The next morning, the voltage was about <code>13.8 V</code>, which seemed pretty good for being nearly three years old.</li>
                <li>In the afternoon, I checked the voltage again and it was now at <code>12.5 V</code>. Upon returning to the car, the voltage lowered a bit to <code>12.3 V</code>. Trying to start the car again did nothing.</li>
                <li>It is possible that the starter and/or the alternator could have problems. The electric starter is what initiates the internal combustion engine and that is the spark that one hears as the car is failing to start. Alternators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy with alternating current (go figure), and it's actually used to recharge the battery and power the rest of the car's electrical system while the engine is running. (Interestingly, before the 60s, most ICEs used commutators instead.)</li>
                <li>Upon attempting the start the car again, this time with the multimeter in place, I saw the voltage quickly drop down to <code>8</code> to <code>9 V</code>. It is also possible then that the battery is unable to provide enough current to start the car.</li>
              </ol>
              <hr>
              <p>It seems that the only way to be sure of the root of the problem is to use another lead-acid battery to confirm whether or not it's the old battery's problem (and I suspect that it is). We shall see.</p>
