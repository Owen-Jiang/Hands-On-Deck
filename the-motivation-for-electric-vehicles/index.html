              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>The Nissan LEAF is the first generation of mass-produced pure-electric family passenger vehicles for the mass market.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>Power scheme</h4>
              <p>The Nissan LEAF adopts an <code>80 kWh</code> permament magnet synchronous motor with a torque of <code>280 N⋅m</code>. As it was the first pure electric vehicle on the mass market, it set the highest standard for all subsequent pure-electric family passenger vehicles in terms of its power scheme and <strong>energy efficiency</strong>.</p>
              <p>Later electric vehicles (such as Tesla's) were not "forced" to achieve this until 2017, and two years later, all such vehicles on the market adopted permanent magnet synchronous motors.</p>
              <p>After 10 years and <code>74,500 miles</code> (<code>119,200 kilometers</code>), the performance of the motor has barely degraded. This is an example of a key difference between electric and internal combustion powertrains (the system that propels the vehicle forward)—electric power greatly simplifies the powertrain of passenger cars and greatly extends the life of the car. It is honestly quite surprising how one of the more complex and fragile parts of the entire internal combustion system becomes, in electric vehicles, the part with the longest lifespan and one with almost zero maintenance requirements. Such a development is a revolutionary step.</p>

            <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1"><a href="../../posts/the-motivation-for-electric-vehicles-energy-solutions.8">The motivation for electric vehicles: Energy solutions</a></h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 28, 2023</p>
            <h4>Energy solutions</h4>
            <p>After the power scheme was electrified, the focus of innovative technology shifted from the narrower engine power to the broader power system—this encompasses the motor and the battery, and especially the latter with respect to its part as an energy system.</p>
            <p>The vehicle uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion_manganese_oxide_battery"><em>lithium ion manganese oxide</em></a> (LMO) batteries (which have lower chances of spontaneous combustion compared to other lithium ion batteries due to lower energy density), divided into <code>96</code> series units, each of which is composed of <code>4</code> flat, rectangular, single cells connected in parallel. These cells are air-cooled, but have no low-temperature battery heating protection. The battery management system (BMS) does not have any other temperature protection measures, only dealing with controlling charging and discharging.</p>
            <p>So far, this may be the only electric car in mass production that utilizes natural air cooling. In terms of long-term operation, there are pros and cons. While Elon Musk has strongly "ridiculed" this model, this vehicle has never had a spontaneous combustion accident, in sharp contrast to the cars of Tesla and other car manufacturers. (<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nissan-leaf-battery-pack-survives-massive-fire-48268.html">One vehicle even survived a forest fire without the battery blowing up!</a>) On the other hand, this format undoubtedly contributes to the long-term decay of the battery's capacity. While this specifically could be due to LMO's particular battery chemistry, there are also many reports of accelerated battery decay in high temperature regions (I wouldn't want to drive one of these in Phoenix during the summer). Thus, in recent years, the LEAF's cooling method has also become more active.</p>

            <p>Based on the test charts shown above, it's clear that after 10 years and after almost <code>75,000 miles</code>, the battery pack's capacity is about <code>63-65%</code> of nominal capcity (that is, capacity out of the factory). Although this statistic exceeds the manufacturer's quality assurance requirements (the battery capacity would not be less than <code>70%</code> after 5 years or <code>60,000 miles</code>, whichever comes first), it is still slightly lower than this battery's expectations a decade ago—it was believed then that the capacity of these batteries, when retired and used for other purposes, would still be at 70-80% of nominal capacity.</p>
            <p>The data show that all the battery cells are intact and the charging/discharging process is normal and stable. The cells have also all passed electrical performance tests, showing that the battery management system has been running stably and reliable for 10 years and over more than 4,000 charging and discharging cycles.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Due to the position of the market, Nissan used an LMO battery with a design capacity of 24 kWh. Although this decision was supported by lots of data (90% of passenger cars in North America have daily mileages under <code>40 miles</code> or <code>64 kilometers</code>), it is obvious that the main factor in this decision was to deal with the high production cost of lithium ion batteries at the time.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The vehicle itself has a single-charge range of about <code>100 miles</code> (<code>160 kilometers</code>) and about <code>120 miles</code> (<code>192 kilometers</code>) in the "ECO" energy-saving mode, leading to an overall energy efficiency of about <code>4 miles/kWh</code> (<code>6 kilometers/kWh</code>). The small energy consumption is quite impressive, and most importantly, it changes little after a decade, the biggest motivator for switching power systems over to electric.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p><strong>Energy efficiency</strong> is the most important detail in energy systems. This point is often overlooked.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In order to further extend battery life, capacity was attempted to be kept between <code>20%</code> and <code>80%</code> as much as possible, so the typical driving range under daily conditions between two successive charges is about <code>60-70 miles</code> (<code>96-112 kilometers</code>). (However, it was found in practice that the lower limit of <code>20%</code> was difficult to maintain, so the actual charging range was effectively <code>10%</code> to <code>80%</code>. And, by the 8th year of operation, with declining battery capacity, it made more sense to cancel the upper limit of 80% and just charge up to 100%.)</p>
            <p>After 10 years, with battery capacity at its current state, one can get a mileage in ECO of <code>60-70 miles</code>, charging from <code>10% to 100%</code>. For long-term use, this can be a good estimate of long-term expectations for such car models.</p>
            <p>Doing the math, the range decreases by about <code>4-5 miles</code> (<code>6-8 kilometers</code>) every year.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Now herewithin lies a practical problem that electric vehicle engineers and designers must deal with in terms of battery capacity. Years past, when discussing the transition from combustion to electric, the emphasis was on the system's overall balance, including the role that software capabilities played in the process. Nowadays, however, we understand that the design of battery capacity is not just an "economic" issue, but also a "software" issue. In other words, the mechanical and electric quality of the batteries is important, but so is the software that controls energy discharge—which cells discharge first, which cells charge first, what the rate of energy release should be, etc.</p>
            <p>Most of the problems that users of this model encounter sometimes are very much related to the "paradoxes" that arise. For example, if users want to protect the battery life by limiting the upper and lower limits of charging, they have to increase the number of charging cycles, which has a negative impact on battery life, especially for DC fast charging sans active cooling. This effect is even more prominent when the battery capacity is already rather small. Basic performance indicators were considered during the design phase's experimentation, but there were only 2,000 charge and discharge cycles, about 6 years' worth. By contrast, this very vehicle has done first and second level charging <code>4192</code> times in 10 years, with only <code>13</code> DC quick charges.</p>
            <p>"Range anxiety" is also prevalent in the minds of other users. This is caused by poor choices by the imbalanced software. Being the first generation of electric vehicles, facing the potential of high costs, it is understandable that this vehicle would adopt a path where there is less redundancy in terms of balance. Still, reality has shown that this software's choice of balance between lifespan extension and actual use is not at the optimal setting. As the scale of batteries increases and the cost decreases, it's clear that <em>increasing the overall battery capacity</em> is the solution. With that, we can limit both amount of capacity charged and discharged as well as the number of charging cycles per unit time, increasing the lifespan and of course, improving overall <strong>energy efficiency</strong>.</p>
            <p>Based on research of vehicle R&D departments over the last few years, it seems that the lower limit of battery capacity should be set at around <code>50-60 kWh</code>. Popular passenger cars for the mass market should even consider aiming for slightly higher.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 1, 2023</p>
            <h4>Mechanical design</h4>
            <p>
              It was believed that after the century-long development of the ICE car that greatly contributed to better understanding of automobile mechanical technology used in automobiles, knowledge would be sufficient to make the mechanical transformation to electric, and the primary devotion would need to be on the power system. It turns out that during this most recent decade and the one before, this hypothesis has been pretty valid—the weakest area of the EV industry is still in the power system. Still, there are some problems in the mechanical designs that took us by surprise.
            </p>
            <h5>The suspension system</h5>
            <p>
              Suspension refers to the system of "cushions", such as the tires and shock absorbers that ties the frame of the vehicle to its wheels. The design of the suspension for ICE cars tends to be mostly the same because the distribution of the weight is the same—it is now settled for the most part that the weight should be either in the front of the vehicle, where the engine is located, or in the back of the vehicle, where a more complicated mechanical design is needed. Most traditional car companies make cars with front-wheel drive, primarily for safety reasons (reducing the chance of a flip). This setup meant the engine was effectively pulling the rest of the vehicle forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the arrival of the electric vehicle, innovative companies were excited to begin using a rear-wheel drive approach (it helps with terrain, it's more balanced, better traction, etc.). However, the addition of an incredibly heavy battery underneath the car threw our previously established setup out of the window. Due to the sheer density and weight of the large traction battery under the car, a upper-lower weight distrubution analysis proved to be more useful than a front-back approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the heaviest component of the entire vehicle, weighing in at around <code>900 lb</code> (<code>400 kg</code>), the lithium-ion battery's only possible and resonable location is under the floor. While this improves stability (it isn't generally safe or sensible to be carrying top-heavy loads in life), this means that over longer periods of time, the suspension would have to deal with a constant downward push by the heavy battery. Given the clearly novel situation, it seems reasonable to advocate for a complete overhaul of the suspension system. It would be necessary to strengthen the front of the car for front-mounted electric motors or pay close attention to the back for rear-mounted electric motors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Nissan LEAF chose to stick with a front suspension, inheriting historical technology, now with some parts of the front suspension under greater stress due to the increased weight. While serious concerns for danger is largely minimal, problems could definitely reoccur here and it is worth ameliorating the increased strain in future designs. On the other hand, Tesla's suspension in particular also leads to problems elsewhere, such as in the running gear and the alignment. Although many different solutions have been tested (air suspension, adaptive automatic suspension, intelligent/real-time adjustment), the fundamental difficulties remain.
            </p>
            <h5>The brake system</h5>
            <p>
              ICEs rely on hydraulic and braking systems to do their job, but some were skeptical that these systems could be replicated in their function with electric vehicles. In recent years, such doubts have been erased—the electric braking system is far more reliable than hydraulic pipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, the initial high cost of traction batteries made it necessary for regenerative braking to become a vital baked-in feature for EVs, and it is now a permanent feature, even after the cost fell later on. It is quite important that this early emphasis on energy efficiency happened; it paves the way for greater economy in energy transfer. In fact, this also greatly reduces the working intensity of the braking system, meaning that the brake pads and discs that previously wore away incredibly quickly on ICEs can now last much longer, a definite benefit to traffic safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              This current vehicle's regenerative braking system is still rather conservative. As of today (December 2023), the vehicle has had two brake pad replacements and one brake disc replacements, but the brake pads on the front of the vehicle have only been replaced once. In newer models, this system is even further enhanced, and the newest models can even do one-pedal driving.
            </p>
            <h5>Environment control of passenger compartment (heating and A/C)</h5>
            <p>
              While initially considered a difficult problem for EVs many years ago, the electrification of climate control is not a big issue in running electric vehicles today—it is, once again, saving electricity and maximizing energy efficiency. In this specific vehicle, it is one of the larger problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In ICE cars, the heating system directly relies on waste heat from the engine's exhaust gas, introducing it into the vehicle's interior, and warming the air. In electric batteries, there is no exhaust, and so a new heating method must be found. Designing such a method requires remembering conservation of energy. Nissan chose, for the LEAF, the most traditional method—harnessing the heat produced by a wire's resistance. Upon initial inspection, the energy consumption was too high for too little results, so resistance heating was added to the seats and the steering wheel. In practice, it was found that using this method for heating had a huge negative impact on performance because pushing hot air with fans is wildly inefficient. Nissan actually recommends that you use the seat warmers instead of the climate control's heat setting. Subsequent companies have learned this lesson and moved to a heat pumps with the seat warmers.

            <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1"><a href="../../posts/the-motivation-for-electric-vehicles-appearance-and-design.10">The motivation for electric vehicles: Appearance and design</a></h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 5, 2023</p>
            <h4>Appearance and design</h4>
            <p>
              Due to the high cost of the first generation of electric vehicle traction batteries, energy conservation became the core issue of the design process: saving energy using all available methods remains still an important consideration today. Among all methods, the tires and the shape of the automobile have become two important research areas not previously paid much attention to in the pre-EV era.
            </p>
            <h5>Tires</h5>
            <p>
              The main directions of innovation for the tires are reduction of weight and reduction of friction. <em>BMW</em> experimented with a "carriage tire" (see <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/dodge-hellcat-on-horse-buggy-wheels-is-an-amish-muscle-car-does-burnouts-155317.html">here</a> for an image that explains what that means), as decreasing surface area in contact with the ground tends to reduce friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              EVs have allowed for many innovations in tire design. For example, the heavy battery leads to a lower center of gravity (and therefore higher stability), which leads to a relaxed active and passive control of the vehicle's balance. Still, as mentioned above, the suspension system should consider strengthening actions, which also requires higher load-bearing requirements on the tires. The best option would be a balance between these two factors, likely further supplemented through innovations of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 2012 Nissan LEAF has a thin, light tire design made of a harder rubber. While its efforts to maintain tire width and improve load-bearing are laudable, it has problems with significantly accelerated tire wear, greater damage possibilities, insufficient repair strength, and negatively affected mileage. Over the 10 years that this car has been in use, the tires have been twice completely replaced and three out of the four tires have twice been completely replaced. Each time, accidents or age wearing the tires away were the culprits, but they all happened when the mileage was far less than the tire warranty's mileage limit of <code>70,000 miles</code>. Still, this issue does need some more research.
            </p>
            <h5>General appearance</h5>
            <p>
              The foremost importance of realism and functional aesthetics in the EV field remains true to this day. Many years ago, it was proposed that no car that was not blown through a wind tunnel could be called an electric car, emphasizing the importance of energy saving in passenger car design. This still has not changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2012 Nissan LEAF specifically has these implementations in mind, and for the most part, the wider traditional passenger car design community dislikes this. To maintain traditional fields of view from the driver's perspective, the headlights were designed to be upward, convex, and streamlined. Additionally, to reach a more compact design, the curved surface of the trunk door and the integration of a rearward spoiler have led to great inconveniences and complaints for users.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, the 2nd Gen Tesla Model S took a different approach: they retained the original headlight shape, but chose to significantly reduce the angles of the front and rear windshield gradients by extending the front and back of the passenger compartment (that is, lengthening the car to decrease the slope of the surface). They also chose to retain the rear hatchback design but removed the rear spoiler. The design community, despite mentioning several problems with the rear door, was mostly happy with these changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both of these different directions of design deserve full recognition. While the customer experience is the starting point for most manufacturers, energy saving requires transcending these problems and as the latter is the starting point for the very existence of these autos, it should be something strongly adhered to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, it is likely that reality will go in a different direction. As the cost of the traction battery falls and supply increases, the language of appearance will be the most important part of future ICEs. This position reflects not only a adaptation of manufacturers to the forces of the market, but also the renewal of cultural and aesthetic ideas in line with the needs and wishes of technological development—the latter tends to adapt to the former.

              The 2012 Nissan LEAF was replaced several years later, with these very unique design factors removed, returning to the original and traditional design mode of appearance. Still, this made this original model important in its very unique milestone in the history of the development of EVs.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
               After a decade of use, the first generation of mass-market lithium-ion battery-powered household electric passenger cars have successfully met the needs of users and basically achieved all of the original design goals. More importantly, these autos have provided valuable experience for the design and manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs) and promoted the full popularization of electric household passenger cars. This car is still very convenient as a local short-distance daily transportation tool. For longer-term use in the future, a reasonable solution for a power battery replacement is needed. This is also an important structural problem in the current development of electric vehicles, which requires more research. (There are relatively reliable structural ways for dealing with the recycling and continued use of traction batteries, which currently need more extensive and powerful practical promotions.)
            </p>
            <p>
               I would like to emphasize once again that if the aforementioned technical research cannot achieve structural results as soon as possible, electric vehicles will be replaced or reused like internal combustion vehicles until they are scrapped, which will lead to great waste. Except for the traction battery, <strong>the working life of the other systems on electric vehicles is <em>much, much longer</em> than that of internal combustion vehicles.</strong>
            </p>

              Postscript: Public health statistics in the United States show that the number of deaths from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning caused by prolonged heating in internal combustion passenger cars remains high every winter, and remains more common in the cold, northern states. Likewise, for a long period of time, carbon monoxide poisoning by household heating or from the exhaust gas from ICE cars in closed passenger compartments or garages remains by far a very common method of suicide in the United States each year. This is very uncommon in other parts of the world.<br>
              As electric vehicles become more popular, this phenomenon and this method will hopefully be gradually reduced.
